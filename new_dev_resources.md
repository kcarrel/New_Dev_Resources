Note: Be wary of [tutorial purgatory](https://dev.to/tonymastrorio/escaping-tutorial-purgatory-as-a-new-developer-1kf3). Taking your new skills to tackle a personal project (Build an api! Make a clone of a website!) is one of my favorite ways to learn. Failure/trial and error can be a great teacher!
